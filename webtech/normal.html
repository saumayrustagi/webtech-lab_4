	<h2><b>Language Choice</b></h2>

	Several people have asked what programming language they should learn first.
	<u>There is no one answer</u>, but consider these points:

	<p>
	<ul>

		<li><b>Use your friends</b>. When asked "what operating system should
			I use, <abbr title="different Operating Systems">Windows, Unix, or Mac?</abbr>", my answer is usually: "use whatever
			your friends use." The advantage you get from learning from your
			friends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or
			between programming languages. Also consider your future friends:
			the community of programmers that you will be a part of if you
			continue. Does your chosen language have a large growing community
			or a small dying one? Are there books, web sites, and online forums
			to get answers from? Do you like the people in those forums?

		<li><b>Keep it simple</b>. Programming languages such as C++
			and Java are designed for professional development by large teams of
			experienced programmers who are concerned about the run-time efficiency of
			their code.
			As a result, these languages have complicated parts designed for these circumstances.
			You're concerned with learning to program. You don't need that complication.
			You want a language that was designed to be easy to learn and remember by a
			single new programmer.

		<li><b>Play.</b> Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the
			normal, interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key,
			or "batch" mode, in which you only hear the notes after you finish a whole song?
			Clearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for the piano, and also for
			programming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it.

	</ul>
